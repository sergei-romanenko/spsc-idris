-- Function composition.

-- This sample shows that SPSC is able to transform a 2-pass algorithm to
-- a 1-pass one.
-- SPSC notes that g(f(A(x))) --> g(B(f(x))) --> C(g(f(x)) and creates
-- a recursively defined function g1 such that calling g1(...) produces
-- the same result as calling g(f(...)).

g(f(u))
where
f(A(x)) = B(f(x));
g(B(x)) = C(g(x));
